# 16_S_rRNA_processing_seasonality_in_sediments
The script in this repository was used to analyses output of the SILVAngs pipeline in the paper "Bacterial communities in temperate and polar coastal sands are seasonally stable"

In futur updates I will try to make the script more automated. For now you can finde several usfull functions and code to plot microbial community composition data based on 16S amplicon sequencing.
